## Hi there! 👋

<img class="avatar" src="/heihei.png" alt="avatar">

My name is Johandielangman 🐓. When I started my coding journey, I was looking for a domain to buy. I guess you could say I always liked using words like "bread" when creating test data. So, I opened Cloudflare, and would you believe it? *happybread.net* was available! I didn’t have to think twice -- I bought it immediately. That’s the *lore* behind the domain. Now, I use it for all my hobbies.

## The Purpose of This Website

Those who know me personally will know that I love [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a writing app that sharpens your thinking -- almost like a second brain. This idea aligns perfectly with Tiago Forte's book *Building a Second Brain*, where he [explains](https://youtu.be/YOLELC41vtk) how we’re living in a time of information overload.  

According to the *New York Times*, "the average person consumes over 34 GB of information a day." How do we manage this? Tiago says:  

> *Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.*

This philosophy is summarized in one key principle: 

> *Don’t try to remember it all. You’re going to be okay. You have a second brain.*

## CODE: Building a Second Brain

We create a second brain through the CODE method:
- **C**apture - Keep what resonates.
- **O**rganize - Make it safe for actionability.
- **D**istill - Extract the essence.
- **E**xpress - Show your work.

When I learn something new, I like to write a few things down. I open up Obsidian and start writing. Once I’m happy with a note, I change its status from *Draft* to *Public*. A simple `git push` to the main repository then builds and deploys my notes to the world. That’s the *E* in CODE—**Express**!  

With this workflow, I can easily and generously share what I’ve learned.
