Have you ever heard of an open-source project called [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)? Let me tell you -- _Streamlit_ is truly lit üî•. It allows you to turn simple Python scripts into shareable web apps in just minutes. Yes, really -- _minutes_! Here's all the code you need to create a basic app:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.write("Hello, World!")
```

One of the coolest features of _Streamlit_ is its ability to deploy your app to their [Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) -- for free! The only trade-off is that your app becomes public by default, unless you choose to share it privately. You can explore what the community has been building in their [Gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery).

Now, this all sounds amazing, but what if I don‚Äôt want everything to be public? What if I prefer not to use their domain name to publish my apps? Believe me, I‚Äôve looked into configuring a DNS. I even found [this article](https://www.restack.io/docs/streamlit-knowledge-streamlit-cloudflare-integration) on deploying with Cloudflare Workers. But honestly? That‚Äôs not for me. I‚Äôd much rather self-host! I already have some ideas on how to make it happen, and if it doesn‚Äôt go as planned, it‚Äôll still be a great learning experience!

I'm also trying something different. This blog post will be an in-depth journal of how I built the repository! That's why it's over 5700 words...

## üêç Setting Up Two Basic Streamlit Apps

The first step is to create an `apps` directory to house your Streamlit applications. Each app (`app_1` and `app_2`) will have its own `requirements.txt` file, treating each as an independent environment. This way, each app can exist in its "own little world."

```text
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_1.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_2/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_2.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
README.md
```

We‚Äôll use Python‚Äôs [Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to isolate dependencies for each app. For now, the `requirements.txt` file is minimal:

```text
streamlit==1.41.*
```

I‚Äôve pinned the `streamlit` dependency at the minor version level, allowing updates for any patch releases.

## üê≥ A Basic Docker Setup to Get Going

### ‚öô The Main Docker Process

The next step is configuring a basic Docker container. We‚Äôll use [VS Code's Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to connect to the container. For this, the container must be running to allow connections.

By default, a Docker container runs a single process, and when this process completes, the container stops. Let‚Äôs demonstrate this with the `hello-world` image:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This outputs:

```text
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
c1ec31eb5944: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:1b7a37f2a0e26e55ba2916e0c53bfbe60d9bd43e390e31aacd25cb3581ed74e6
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

Running `docker ps -a` will list all containers, including those that have exited:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
c6fdd29065fc   hello-world   "/hello"                 2 minutes ago   Exited (0) 2 minutes ago              boring_mclean
```

In this case, the main process inside the `hello-world` container simply prints a message to the screen and then exits.

### üîÅ Keeping the Docker Container Running

A lightweight way to keep a container running is to use:

```bash
tail -f /dev/null
```

This command creates an infinite loop where `tail` continuously attempts to read from `/dev/null`. Since `/dev/null` is always empty, `tail` remains in a waiting state.

To test this, run:

```bash
docker run -d --name tail-demo alpine tail -f /dev/null
```

If your terminal doesn‚Äôt register the last "l" correctly, an alternative is:

```bash
docker run -d --name tail-demo alpine sh -c "tail -f /dev/null"
```

Now, running `docker ps -a` should show:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
2813c19cc028   alpine        "sh -c 'tail -f /dev‚Ä¶"   6 seconds ago    Up 5 seconds                          tail-demo
c6fdd29065fc   hello-world   "/hello"                 20 minutes ago   Exited (0) 20 minutes ago             boring_mclean
```

### üõë Stopping and Cleaning Up Containers

To stop the `tail-demo` container, use:

```bash
docker stop --time=10 tail-demo
```

This sends a `SIGTERM` signal, allowing the container to shut down gracefully within the specified 10-second grace period. If the container does not stop in time, Docker will send a `SIGKILL`. You can adjust the grace period using the `--time` flag.

To remove the containers, use either the name or container ID:

```bash
docker rm tail-demo
docker rm c6fdd29065fc
```

### üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Supervisor, Dockerfile, and Makefile

The [Supervisor](https://supervisord.org/) program is an excellent tool for managing multiple running processes in a Linux environment. By integrating it into your container, you can effectively manage multiple services within the container itself.

Using Supervisor in a container allows you to manage more than one service in a seamless and organized way. For example, **Supervisor** is a process control system for UNIX-like operating systems that helps manage long-running processes. Here's an example of a `Dockerfile` utilizing Supervisor:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04  

ARG APP_ENV  

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y supervisor  

WORKDIR /self-hosted-streamlit-apps  

COPY . /self-hosted-streamlit-apps  
COPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/  

CMD ["supervisord", "-c", "/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf"]
```

Supervisor provides robust control and better process management, making it easy to monitor and handle processes. Even if a process inside the container needs restarting, the main process (`supervisord`) will continue running as PID 1, ensuring the container remains operational.

This approach is ideal for running more complex workloads inside a container.

To start, we can create a simple `supervisord.conf` file with a basic configuration:

```conf
[supervisord]
nodaemon=true  

[program:tail]
command=tail -f /dev/null  
autostart=true  
```

This minimal configuration helps us get started. Next, let's build our image using [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/). The following command includes an `APP_ENV` build argument to specify the type of container being built:

```bash
docker build --build-arg APP_ENV=production -t self-hosted-streamlit-prod .
```

If this is your first time pulling the `ubuntu` image, it might take some time, so grab a coffee while you wait. Once the image is built, you can run it using:

```bash
docker run -d --name streamlit --env-file .env self-hosted-streamlit-prod
```

You may notice the `--env-file` argument. This allows you to include API keys or other sensitive information later. To prevent accidental leaks, add `.env` to both `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files:

```
.env  
apps/*/.env  
```

Where the contents of our `.env` file will have the following:

```text
HELLO="WORLD"
```

Let's confirm everything is running with `docker ps -a`:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES  
c6fda0d60b6d   self-hosted-streamlit-prod   "/usr/bin/supervisor‚Ä¶"   17 seconds ago   Up 16 seconds                         streamlit  
```

Everything looks good! You can now enter the container in interactive mode using:

```bash
docker exec -it streamlit sh
```

Once inside, verify that your environment variables are accessible, e.g., `echo $HELLO` should return `"WORLD"`. Running `ls -la` will also confirm that `.env` wasn't copied into the container.

Remembering all these commands can be tedious. To simplify, we can use [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) to install `make`:

```bash
scoop install make  
```

This allows us to define a [**Makefile**](https://makefiletutorial.com/) for easier management:

```Makefile
IMAGE_NAME_PROD=self-hosted-streamlit-prod  

build-prod:  
	docker build --build-arg APP_ENV=production -t $(IMAGE_NAME_PROD) .  

run-prod:  
	docker run -d --name $(CONTAINER_NAME_PROD) --env-file .env $(IMAGE_NAME_PROD)  

exec-prod:  
	docker exec -it $(CONTAINER_NAME_PROD) sh  

start-prod:  
	docker start $(CONTAINER_NAME_PROD)  

stop-prod:  
	docker stop $(CONTAINER_NAME_PROD)  

remove-prod:  
	docker rm $(CONTAINER_NAME_PROD)  

rebuild-prod: stop-prod remove-prod build-prod run-prod  
```

With this setup, you can easily manage the lifecycle of your container:

- **Build the image**: `make build-prod`
- **Run the container**: `make run-prod`
- **Access the container shell**: `make exec-prod`
- **Stop the container**: `make stop-prod`
- **Remove the container**: `make remove-prod`
- **Rebuild everything**: `make rebuild-prod`

This approach simplifies container management and can be easily extended for a development environment.

Our directory currently looks like this:

```text
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_1.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_2/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_2.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
.dockerignore
.env
.gitignore
Brewfile
Makefile
README.md
supervisord.conf
```

## üí™ Creating a better `supervisor.conf` File

### ‚õè Setting Up `supervisorctl`

To fully unlock the capabilities of `supervisorctl`, we need to configure our `supervisor.conf` file. The first step is setting up a [`unix_http_server`](https://supervisord.org/configuration.html#unix-http-server-section-settings) section. This enables us to manage processes using commands like `supervisorctl restart app_1`.

`supervisorctl` communicates with `supervisord` via XML-RPC over a specified port. For a good `chmod` reference, this [chmod calculator](https://nettools.club/chmod_calc) can be handy.

The [documentation](https://supervisord.org/configuration.html#unix-http-server-section-example) advises against using the `/tmp` directory as shown in the examples. Instead, we‚Äôll use the `/var` directory:

```ini
[unix_http_server]
file=/var/run/supervisor.sock
chmod=0700

[supervisorctl]
serverurl=unix:///var/run/supervisor.sock
```

The `supervisorctl` section simply [points to the socket file](https://supervisord.org/configuration.html#supervisorctl-section-values). Additionally, we can define global settings for the `supervisord` process:

```ini
[supervisord]
logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid
childlogdir=/var/log/supervisor
nodaemon=true
```

Finally, include this [RPC interface setting](https://supervisord.org/configuration.html#rpcinterface-x-section-settings):

```ini
[rpcinterface:supervisor]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface
```

Per the documentation:

> If you don‚Äôt need any additional functionality beyond what `supervisor` provides out of the box, this is all you need to configure.

Here‚Äôs the complete configuration file:

```ini
[unix_http_server]
file=/var/run/supervisor.sock
chmod=0700

[supervisord]
logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid
childlogdir=/var/log/supervisor
nodaemon=true

[rpcinterface:supervisor]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface

[supervisorctl]
serverurl=unix:///var/run/supervisor.sock

[program:tail]
command=tail -f /dev/null
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/tail.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/tail.out.log
```

## üåç Creating Python Virtual Environments for each app and updating Supervisor

### üê≥ Revisiting our Dockerfile

Now for the real MVP -- Python üêç! I explored options like installing Python via `apt-get`, `Homebrew`, and even building it from source. Ultimately, I decided to use a base image with Python pre-installed. Since my laptop uses Python **3.11**, I chose the `python:3.11-slim` Docker image.

Here‚Äôs the updated Dockerfile! I'll get to the juicy details üßÉ

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

# ====== Environment Variables ======
ENV APP_ROOT=/self-hosted-streamlit-apps

# ====== Arguments ======
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# ====== Install Dependencies ======
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    file \
    git \
    supervisor \
    nginx \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# ====== Working Directory Setup ======
WORKDIR $APP_ROOT
COPY . .
RUN mkdir -p /var/log/supervisor

# ====== Build Scripts ======

RUN python build.py -dH && \
    cp supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf

# ====== Entrypoint and Healthcheck ======
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s --retries=3 \
  CMD python healthcheck.py || exit 1

CMD ["/usr/bin/supervisord", "-n", "-c", "/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf"]
```

After revisiting the [documentation](docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile), I refined the setup with a few best practices:

- [`ENV`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#env): Sets the root path for scripts requiring it.
- [`ARG`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#arg): Helps during installation (`DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`). The docs mentioned that it's better to add it as a build `ARG` instead of an environment `ENV`
- [`HEALTHCHECK`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck): Ensures the container is functioning properly, adding a `healthy` status. When a container has a healthcheck specified, it has a health status in addition to its normal status. This status is initially¬†`starting`. Whenever a health check passes, it becomes¬†`healthy`¬†(whatever state it was previously in). After a certain number of consecutive failures, it becomes¬†`unhealthy`.
- I've also removed the [`COPY`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#copy) instruction to copy the `supervisord.conf` file. The `COPY` creates a layer and caches it. This is a problem when you want to run scripts like `build.py` which modifies the `supervisord.conf` file
- I've also added `nginx` to the installation. More on that later!

I also removed the `APP_ENV` `ARG` since I wanted the variable to persist across environments. I added a `-e APP_ENV=PROD` and `-e APP_ENV=DEV` argument after the `--env-file` arguments in the `run-*` Make commands

### üêç Python Scripts: `build.py` and `healthcheck.py`

You‚Äôre probably wondering what `build.py` and `healthcheck.py` are for. Well... I know bash scripting was designed for tasks like these. I could spend days learning it, or I could use an LLM (which might turn it into a mysterious black box of unicorns), but instead, I decided to write the build and health check logic in Python! It‚Äôs a language I‚Äôm comfortable with, and the container is already set up for it.

Here‚Äôs a simple starting point for `healthcheck.py`:

```python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(0)  # Healthy!
```

I‚Äôll revisit this file later since I don‚Äôt yet know what would make it truly ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù After running `make rebuild-prod`, I can confirm it works:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
fa4ae30d7e94   self-hosted-streamlit-prod   "/usr/bin/supervisor‚Ä¶"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute (healthy)             streamlit-prod
```

Cool üòé!

As for the `build.py` file, its primary job is to create a virtual environment for each Streamlit app and append the necessary settings to the `supervisord.conf` file. I‚Äôm planning to add two arguments to this script:

- `-d`, `--deploy`: A flag that must be explicitly set. When enabled, it modifies the configuration files.
- `-H`, `--hard`: Removes the existing virtual environments (`.venv`) and creates new ones.

I won‚Äôt go into all the nitty-gritty details, but let‚Äôs review the key functions. The script includes a `main` function, which orchestrates everything:

```python
def main(args: argparse.Namespace) -> None:
    if not os.path.exists(APPS_ROOT_PATH):
        _e: str = f"Could not find {APPS_ROOT_PATH}"
        logger.critical(_e)
        raise FileNotFoundError(_e)

    for app_folder_name in os.listdir(APPS_ROOT_PATH):
        app_folder_path: str = os.path.join(APPS_ROOT_PATH, app_folder_name)
        logger.info(f"Building {app_folder_name}")

        # =========== // STEP 1: LOAD SETUP FILE // ===========

        logger.info(f"[{app_folder_name}] Loading settings...")
        setup: Setup = load_setup(app_folder_path)

        # =========== // STEP 2: CREATE VENV AND INSTALL PACKAGES // ===========

        logger.info(f"[{app_folder_name}] Creating venv and installing Python dependencies...")
        create_venv_and_install(
            setup=setup,
            args=args
        )

        # =========== // STEP 3: UPDATE SUPERVISOR CONF // ===========

        if args.deploy:
            logger.info(f"[{app_folder_name}] Updating Supervisor configuration...")
            backup_file(SUPERVISOR_CONF_PATH)
            update_supervisor_conf(
                setup=setup
            )
        else:
            logger.info("Skipping Supervisor update")

        # =========== // STEP 4: UPDATE NGINX CONF // ===========

        if args.deploy:
            logger.info(f"[{app_folder_name}] Updating Nginx configuration...")
            update_nginx_conf(
                setup=setup
            )
        else:
            logger.info("Skipping Nginx update")
```

The `main` function performs the following steps for each folder in the `./apps` directory:

1. Loads the settings file.
2. Creates a virtual environment and installs the required packages.
3. Updates the Supervisor configuration (if the `--deploy` flag is set).
4. Updates the Nginx configuration (also dependent on the `--deploy` flag).

There‚Äôs still some work to do, particularly with setting up the Nginx configuration, but this is a solid starting point!
#### üîç (1) Loading a Settings File

After my morning run, I had a great idea: why not use Python‚Äôs built-in `tomllib` package to manage each app‚Äôs settings? Each app will now have its own `setup.toml` file in its root directory. Here‚Äôs an example of the `setup.toml` file for `app_1`:

```toml
title = "App 1"

[owner]
name = "Johan"

[streamlit]
port = 8001
base_path = "/app-1"
entry_file = "app_1.py"
```

Thanks, [TOML](https://toml.io/en/)! The `load_setup` function reads this file and initializes a dataclass to validate the settings easily:

```python
@dataclass
class Owner:
    name: str = ""


@dataclass
class Streamlit:
    port: int
    base_path: str
    entry_file: str


@dataclass
class Setup:
    title: str = ""
    owner: Owner = None
    streamlit: Streamlit = None
    app_folder_path: str = ""
    pip_path: str = ""
    python_path: str = ""


def load_setup(
    app_folder_path: str,
    setup_name: str = SETUP_NAME
) -> Setup:
    with open(os.path.join(app_folder_path, setup_name), "rb") as f:
        data = tomllib.load(f)
    return Setup(
        title=data['title'],
        owner=Owner(**data['owner']),
        streamlit=Streamlit(**data['streamlit']),
        app_folder_path=app_folder_path
    )
```

Using dataclasses has several advantages, but the biggest one for me is the autocomplete feature. When I type `setup.streamlit.port`, I get suggestions all the way! It also helps me see all available options as I type. I'm a huge fan.
#### üîç (2) Creating a Virtual Environment and Installing Packages

The `create_venv_and_install` function handles the following:

```python
def create_venv_and_install(
    setup: Setup,
    args: argparse.Namespace
) -> None:

    # =========== // STEP 1: SET PYTHON AND PIP PATHS // ===========

    venv_path: str = os.path.join(setup.app_folder_path, VENV_NAME)

    if sys.platform == "win32":
        pip_path = os.path.join(venv_path, "Scripts", "pip")
        python_path = os.path.join(venv_path, "Scripts", "python")
    else:
        pip_path = os.path.join(venv_path, "bin", "pip")
        python_path = os.path.join(venv_path, "bin", "python")

    # Store these paths for later use
    setup.pip_path = pip_path
    setup.python_path = python_path

    # =========== // STEP 2: HANDLE HARD RESET // ===========

    if args.hard_reset and os.path.exists(venv_path):
        logger.info(f"[{setup.title}] Removing {venv_path}")
        shutil.rmtree(venv_path)

    # =========== // STEP 3: CREATE AND INSTALL // ===========

    if not os.path.exists(venv_path):
        # ==========> STEP 3.1: CREATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
        logger.debug(f"[{setup.title}] Creating virtual environment")
        run_command(
            [
                PY,
                "-m",
                "venv",
                venv_path
            ]
        )

        # ==========> STEP 3.2: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
        logger.debug(f"[{setup.title}] Installing requirements")
        run_command(
            [
                pip_path,
                "install",
                "-r",
                "requirements.txt"
            ],
            cwd=setup.app_folder_path
        )
    else:
        logger.warning(f"[{setup.title}] {VENV_NAME} already exists. Use `--hard` to remove it.")
```

This function can be broken down into three main steps:

1. **Set the Python and pip paths**  
    Based on the platform, the `python_path` and `pip_path` are determined. For Windows, they‚Äôre located in the `Scripts` directory; for Linux and similar systems (like containers), they‚Äôre in the `bin` directory. These full paths are saved for later use.
    
2. **Handle a hard reset**  
    If the `--hard` argument is passed, any existing virtual environment is removed.
    
3. **Create the virtual environment and install dependencies**
    - **Step 3.1**: Create the virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv`.
    - **Step 3.2**: Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The `run_command` function is a simple wrapper around `subprocess.run` to handle system commands:

```python
def run_command(
    command: List[str],
    cwd: Optional[str] = None
) -> None:
    result: subprocess.CompletedProcess = subprocess.run(
        command,
        cwd=cwd,
        text=True
    )
    result.check_returncode()
```

This wrapper ensures that commands run in the specified directory (if provided) and raises an error if the command fails.
#### üîç (3) Updating the Supervisor Configuration

The `update_supervisor_conf` function is executed only when the `args.deploy` argument is passed to the script. Here's how the function is defined:

```python
def update_supervisor_conf(
    setup: Setup
) -> None:
    with open(SUPERVISOR_CONF_PATH, "a") as f:
        f.write("\n")
        f.write(
            create_supervisor_program_str(
                app_name=to_snake_case(str(setup.title)),
                python_path=setup.python_path,
                app_folder_path=setup.app_folder_path,
                app_python_file=setup.streamlit.entry_file,
                server_base_path=setup.streamlit.base_path,
                server_port=setup.streamlit.port
            )
        )
```

This function takes the properties of a `Setup` instance and appends the output of `create_supervisor_program_str` to the `supervisord.conf` file, referenced here as `SUPERVISOR_CONF_PATH`.

The `create_supervisor_program_str` function formats the input arguments into a Supervisor-compatible configuration string. Here‚Äôs how it looks:

```python
def create_supervisor_program_str(
    *,
    app_name: str,
    python_path: str,
    app_python_file: str,
    app_folder_path: str,
    server_port: int,
    server_base_path: str
) -> str:
    return """[program:{app_name}]
    command={python_path} -m streamlit run {app_python_file} --server.port={server_port} --server.baseUrlPath={server_base_path}
    directory={app_folder_path}
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/{app_name}.err.log
    stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/{app_name}.out.log
    """.format(
        app_name=app_name,
        python_path=python_path,
        app_python_file=app_python_file,
        app_folder_path=app_folder_path,
        server_port=server_port,
        server_base_path=server_base_path
    )
```

Notice the use of the `*` argument notation to enforce keyword arguments. Although an f-string could have been used here, I decided to revisit `.format()` for nostalgic purposes! The formatted output for an app might look like this:

```ini
[program:app_1]
    command=/self-hosted-streamlit-apps/apps/app_1/.venv/bin/python -m streamlit run app_1.py --server.port=8001 --server.baseUrlPath=/app-1
    directory=/self-hosted-streamlit-apps/apps/app_1
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/app_1.err.log
    stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/app_1.out.log
```

**Testing the Configuration**

Before diving into NGINX, let‚Äôs test this setup. First, add the following commands to your Makefile:

```makefile
run-prod-80:
	docker run -d --name $(CONTAINER_NAME_PROD) --env-file .env -e APP_ENV=PROD -p 80:80 $(IMAGE_NAME_PROD)
	
rebuild-prod-80: stop-prod remove-prod build-prod run-prod-80
```

These commands allow you to create a container and map port 80 on your machine to the container. Now, run `make run-prod-80` to start the container. The output of `docker ps -a` should confirm the port mapping:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                      PORTS                NAMES
1d2dc7b470b8   self-hosted-streamlit-prod   "/usr/bin/supervisor‚Ä¶"   7 seconds ago   Up 6 seconds (healthy)      0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   streamlit-prod
```

The port mapping looks correct! Next, use `make exec-prod` to access the container and verify that everything is running. Executing `supervisorctl status` inside the container should return:

```text
app_1                            RUNNING   pid 7, uptime 0:00:39
app_2                            RUNNING   pid 8, uptime 0:00:39
tail                             RUNNING   pid 9, uptime 0:00:39
```

It‚Äôs working as expected! Now, open `http://localhost:80/app-1` in your browser, and voil√†:

![localhost-app-1](/images/localhost-app-1.png)

üéâü•≥üéâ Success! After all that hard work, it's incredibly satisfying to see everything come together!
#### üîç (3) Updating the NGINX Configuration

I'll be honest‚ÄîI'm still relatively new to NGINX, so this was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding! The goal here is to use `build.py` to generate an `nginx.conf` file and copy it to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`. The updated `Dockerfile` now includes:

```dockerfile
RUN python build.py -dH && \
    cp supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf && \
    cp nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default && \
    ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

While setting this up, I ran into a similar issue as described in [this DigitalOcean forum post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/etc-nginx-sites-enabled-default-not-found). Adding the _symlink_ above resolved it. Reading through the [Streamlit Forum](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/deploy-streamlit-with-nginx-docker/52907), I found the following NGINX configuration suggested by users:

```nginx
server {
    server_name website.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8501/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    location /_stcore/stream {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8501/_stcore/stream;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }
}
```

Since I use custom base paths for each app, I modified the configuration as follows:

```nginx
location /app-1/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8001/app-1/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}

location /app-1/_stcore/stream {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8001/app-1/_stcore/stream;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_read_timeout 86400;
}
```

One critical note: **always include the trailing slash** in `proxy_pass`. It took me three cups of coffee to figure that out! ‚òï‚òï‚òï

For simplicity, I left the other NGINX defaults unchanged. The main idea is to have the script generate the initial `nginx.conf` file with the first app's configuration:

```python
return f"""
server {{
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    # Streamlit apps
    {locations}

    # Default location block
    location / {{
        return 404;
    }}
}}
"""
```

To add more apps later, the script replaces the `# Default location block` comment with the next app's configuration, then re-adds the comment:

```python
new_config = existing_config.replace(
    "    # Default location block",
    f"    {location_block}\n    # Default location block"
)
```

Here‚Äôs the implementation of `update_nginx_conf`:

```python
def update_nginx_conf(
    setup: Setup
) -> None:
    # First-time file creation
    if not os.path.exists(NGINX_CONF_PATH):
        logger.info(f"[{setup.title}] Creating new nginx configuration")
        with open(NGINX_CONF_PATH, "w") as f:
            f.write(create_nginx_config([setup]))
    else:
        # Update existing configuration
        with open(NGINX_CONF_PATH, "r") as f:
            existing_config = f.read()

        backup_file(NGINX_CONF_PATH)
        location_block = create_nginx_location_block(
            base_path=setup.streamlit.base_path,
            port=setup.streamlit.port
        )

        if location_block not in existing_config:
            new_config = existing_config.replace(
                "    # Default location block",
                f"    {location_block}\n    # Default location block"
            )
            with open(NGINX_CONF_PATH, "w") as f:
                f.write(new_config)
```

The initial configuration is generated using `create_nginx_config`:

```python
def create_nginx_config(
    setups: List[Setup]
) -> str:
    locations = "\n".join(
        create_nginx_location_block(
            base_path=setup.streamlit.base_path,
            port=setup.streamlit.port
        )
        for setup in setups
    )

    return f"""
server {{
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    # Streamlit apps
    {locations}

    # Default location block
    location / {{
        return 404;
    }}
}}
"""
```

The `create_nginx_location_block` function generates the location configuration for each app:

```python
def create_nginx_location_block(
    *,
    base_path: str,
    port: int
) -> str:
    # Ensure base_path starts with / and ends with /
    if not base_path.startswith('/'):
        base_path = '/' + base_path
    if not base_path.endswith('/'):
        base_path = base_path + '/'

    return f"""
    location {base_path} {{
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:{port}{base_path};
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }}

    location {base_path}_stcore/stream {{
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:{port}{base_path}_stcore/stream;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }}
    """
```

After some trial and error, this setup worked perfectly! Now, running `make rebuild-prod-80` and navigating to `http://localhost/app-1/` displays:

![localhost-nginx-app-1](/images/localhost-nginx-app-1.png)

And visiting `http://localhost/app-2/` shows:

![localhost-nginx-app-2](/images/localhost-nginx-app-2.png)

üéâü•≥ Success! Seeing it all come together is so satisfying!

## ü©∫ Configuring Health Checks for the Container

Remember the `healthcheck.py` file we set aside earlier? It‚Äôs time to revisit it. Currently, there are two key checks I want to implement:

1. Are all `supervisor` processes running?
2. Can I access `http://localhost:80/`?

This serves as a solid starting point. I also want the ability to override these health checks for debugging purposes. To achieve this, I‚Äôve added an `ENV ALWAYS_HEALTHY=false` instruction to the container. This allows the following logic in `healthcheck.py`:

```python
ALWAYS_HEALTHY: bool = str(os.getenv("ALWAYS_HEALTHY", "false")).lower() == "true"
if ALWAYS_HEALTHY:
    logger.info(f"{_p} ALWAYS_HEALTHY is enabled")
    sys.exit(0)
```

If something isn‚Äôt healthy, we want to know why! To facilitate this, we‚Äôll set up a log handler to save logs to a file. To prevent the logs from growing indefinitely, we‚Äôll use `RotatingFileHandler` to manage file rotation. Here‚Äôs the configuration:

```python
logger: logging.Logger = logging.getLogger(PROG_NAME)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

stdout_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
stdout_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
stdout_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(stdout_handler)

if sys.platform != "win32":
    os.makedirs(LOG_DIR, exist_ok=True)
    file_handler = RotatingFileHandler(
        filename=LOG_FILE,
        maxBytes=10 * 1024 * 1024,  # 10MB
        backupCount=5,  # Keep 5 backup files
        encoding='utf-8'
    )
    file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
```

Here‚Äôs the entry point for `healthcheck.py`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    _p: str = "[CHECK]"
    logger.info(f"{_p} Starting health check")

    # =========== // ALWAYS_HEALTHY // ===========

    if ALWAYS_HEALTHY:
        logger.info(f"{_p} ALWAYS_HEALTHY is enabled")
        sys.exit(0)

    # =========== // CHECK SUPERVISOR // ===========

    processes: Optional[List[Dict]] = get_supervisor_status()
    if not processes:
        logger.critical(f"{_p} UNHEALTHY - Unable to fetch supervisorctl status")
        sys.exit(1)

    if not check_supervisor_all_running(processes):
        sys.exit(1)

    # =========== // CHECK LINKS // ===========

    for url in LINKS_TO_CHECK:
        if check_ping(url):
            logger.info(f"{_p} {url} is online")
        else:
            logger.critical(f"{_p} Unable to reach {url}")
            sys.exit(1)

    # =========== // HEALTHY! // ===========

    logger.info(f"{_p} All systems are GO!")
    sys.exit(0)
```

The `get_supervisor_status` function runs the `supervisorctl status` command using `subprocess.run`, similar to how we handled virtual environments in `build.py`:

```python
def get_supervisor_status() -> Optional[List[Dict]]:
    try:
        result: subprocess.CompletedProcess = subprocess.run(
            ['supervisorctl', 'status'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True
        )

        processes: List[Dict] = []
        for line in result.stdout.split('\n'):
            if line.strip():
                parts: List[str] = re.split(r'\s+', line.strip(), maxsplit=2)
                if len(parts) >= 2:
                    process: Dict[str, str] = {
                        'name': parts[0],
                        'status': parts[1],
                        'details': parts[2] if len(parts) > 2 else ''
                    }
                    processes.append(process)
        return processes
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error running supervisorctl: {e}")
        logger.error(f"Error output: {e.stderr}")
        return None
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("supervisorctl command not found. Is Supervisor installed?")
        return None
```

If the result is empty, we immediately flag it as unhealthy. If a list of dictionaries is returned, we pass it to `check_supervisor_all_running`, which evaluates each process and logs its status:

```python
def check_supervisor_all_running(
    processes: List[Dict],
    ignore: List[str] = SUPERVISOR_STATUS_IGNORE
) -> bool:
    if not processes:
        logger.critical("No processes to check")
        return False

    status: bool = True
    for supervisor_process in processes:
        if supervisor_process['name'] not in ignore:
            if supervisor_process['status'] == 'FATAL':
                logger.critical(f"{supervisor_process['name']} - FATAL - {supervisor_process['details']}")
                status = False
            else:
                logger.info(f"{supervisor_process['name']} - {supervisor_process['status']} - {supervisor_process['details']}")
    return status
```

We use a flag to log all unhealthy processes before returning the overall status.

Finally, the `check_ping` function sends a simple HTTP GET request to verify if critical URLs are reachable:

```python
LINKS_TO_CHECK: List[str] = [
    "http://localhost:80/app-1"
]

def check_ping(url: str) -> bool:
    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
        return response.getcode() == 200
    except Exception:
        return False
```

When executed, `docker ps -a` confirms the container is healthy:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                      PORTS                NAMES
a13044ba9513   self-hosted-streamlit-prod   "/usr/bin/supervisor‚Ä¶"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes (healthy)      0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   streamlit-prod
```

And inspecting the logs with `cat /var/log/healthcheck.log` inside the container produces:

```
2025-01-18 14:13:57,833 - healthcheck.py - INFO - [CHECK] Starting health check

2025-01-18 14:13:58,078 - healthcheck.py - INFO - [CHECK] All systems are GO!
```

## ‚òÅ Setting Up Cloudflare Tunneling for Easy SSL

I won‚Äôt dive too deep into this section since Cloudflare provides an excellent [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/) on the subject.

For installation, I chose to download the latest release directly from [the source](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/#latest-release):

```Dockerfile
RUN curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/cloudflared && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
RUN mkdir -p /var/log/supervisor /etc/cloudflared
COPY cloudflare/ /etc/cloudflared/
```

Next, I added the following Supervisor program configuration for Cloudflare:

```ini
[program:cloudflared]
command=/usr/local/bin/cloudflared tunnel run dash
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/cloudflared.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/cloudflared.out.log
```

## üöÄ Deployment

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthe cloud can be a daunting and expensive place. Instead of deploying to AWS, I repurposed an old laptop, cloned the repository, ran the Makefiles, and deployed it locally.

Feel free to check it out! Just a heads-up: I might accidentally kill the process at some point.

Here are the links:

- [https://dash.happybread.net/app-1](https://dash.happybread.net/app-1)
- [https://dash.happybread.net/app-2](https://dash.happybread.net/app-2)

## ü§î Conclusion

I‚Äôm still refining the code, but if you want to see what the repository looked like at the time of writing this blog, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Johandielangman/streamlit-host/tree/blog-post).

I have a few ideas brewing for the next blog post, so stay tuned!

Let me know what you think!
