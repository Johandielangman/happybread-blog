For anyone looking to learn a new programming language, I highly recommend giving [Advent of Code]( [https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/) ) a try! It’s like a Christmas-flavored #Leetcode. Each day increases in difficulty! Last week, the great [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) released this video on [▶ THE WHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf48XDnXtKI) of Advent of Code! 

I have to say, it really feels amazing once you finally get that gold star!

Following the example of Prime, I'm going to try to learn golang this year. We'll see how far I get.
