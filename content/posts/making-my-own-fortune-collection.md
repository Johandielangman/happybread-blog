Everyone loves a good _Cowsay_. I enjoy opening my terminal and being greeted by my favorite little ASCII cow, spouting some random quote.

_But the quotes never make any sense!_ They're not funny, they're not insightful -- honestly, they're barely coherent.

When the cow catches the eyes of my coworkers, they usually ask,

> ‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù

And I say,

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cow. Every time I open my terminal, he greets me with a random quote.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome! Let‚Äôs read the quote!‚Äù they reply. Our reaction to the quote:

The random quotes come from something called a [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_\(Unix\)) -- a classic Unix program that dates back to the 1970s. I installed it the easy way using Homebrew: `brew install fortune`

But I wanted custom fortunes. Ones I enjoy. Ones I collect over time. Like Pok√©mon.

Sure, I could‚Äôve just downloaded the collection from [JKirchartz‚Äôs repo](https://github.com/JKirchartz/fortunes), pointed the script to that folder, and called it a day. But where‚Äôs the fun in that? I wanted to write my own script: something that could randomly select a file of fortunes, read its contents, split it by `%`, and return a random one. I got this logic from the Wiki. `#credible`

I could‚Äôve done it in a language I know and love, like Python. But I didn‚Äôt.

Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring other languages like Go, and frankly, I was in desperate need of a project to help me learn. This little fortune project? It was the perfect fit.

## üîµ Building my own fortune using Go

My main idea is to have a `fortunes` directory in the same path as the script. This directory will contain a bunch of text files with all my fortunes.

![fortunes_collection](/images/fortunes_collection.png)

The first step is to write something that ensures this folder exists. In the `main()` function, I do this by calling my own `dirExists` function:

```go
func dirExists(path string) (bool, error) {
	if _, err := os.Stat(path); err == nil {
		return true, nil
	} else if os.IsNotExist(err) {
		return false, nil
	} else {
		return false, err
	}
}

func main() {
	// DECLARE SOME VARIABLES
	FORTUNE_COLLECTION_DIR := "fortunes"

	// ====> CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE FORTUNE DIRECORY EXISTS
	if exists, err := dirExists(FORTUNE_COLLECTION_DIR); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	} else if !exists {
		log.Fatal("Could not find your fortune directory")
	}
}
```

Go has a very interesting mechanic for handling errors. Most functions return the result you want _and_ an `err`. You then evaluate the error and decide whether to panic and exit the program. You can either log it with `log.Fatal`, or panic with `panic()`. Yes, that function exists. I mostly use `log.Fatal` since it includes a timestamp. `panic()` seems more verbose.

So I stuck to this pattern when creating the `dirExists` function.

Right. We checked if the folder exists. Next step is to list all the fortune files and to choose a random `*.txt` file:

```go
fortuneFiles := listFortuneFiles(FORTUNE_COLLECTION_DIR)
fortuneFile := chooseRandomElement(fortuneFiles)
```

Here's how `listFortuneFiles` works:

```go
func listFortuneFiles(path string) []string {
	var fortuneFiles []string

	items, err := os.ReadDir(path)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	for _, item := range items {
		if !item.IsDir() && strings.HasSuffix(item.Name(), ".txt") {
			fortuneFiles = append(fortuneFiles, item.Name())
		}
	}
	return fortuneFiles
}
```

Here, I tried something different. Instead of returning the error, I handle it inside the function ‚Äî similar to how many Python functions behave. Just playing around with different design patterns.

This function loops over the items returned by `os.ReadDir`, filters out anything that's not a `.txt` file, and appends valid files to a `fortuneFiles` slice.

Oh, and one more thing: all functions in this `main` package are private. How can you tell? In Go, a function is private if it starts with a lowercase letter. If I had named it `ListFortuneFiles`, it would‚Äôve been public. Since I'm not exporting anything, this doesn't matter ‚Äî but it‚Äôs an interesting mechanic.

After we get our slice of strings, we need to choose a random one. In Go, there is no `random.choice(list)` function like in Python. Or maybe there is. I'm new to this. Anyway. Let's make our own one called `chooseRandomElement`

```go
func chooseRandomElement(slice []string) string {
	return slice[rand.Intn(len(slice))]
}
```

It's really simple. It takes a slice of strings and gets the index of one of the slices based on a random integer derived from the length of the slice.

Now for the juicy part. Reading in the fortunes from the fortunes file. 

```go
fortunes := readFortunes(filepath.Join(FORTUNE_COLLECTION_DIR, fortuneFile))
```

I like using `filepath.Join` to build paths -- it's the safest, most portable way to do it. I was thrilled to find that Go has this built-in.

So `readFortunes` looks something like this:

```go
func readFortunes(path string) []string {
	var (
		fortunes []string
		chunk    []string
	)

	rawFile, err := os.ReadFile(path)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Damn Windows
	rawFileString := strings.ReplaceAll(string(rawFile), "\r\n", "\n")

	lines := strings.Split(rawFileString, "\n")

	for _, line := range lines {
		if strings.TrimSpace(line) == "%" {
			// To account for a % at the top with no content above it
			if len(chunk) > 0 {
				// Rebuild the par and add to the final slice
				fortunes = append(fortunes, strings.Join(chunk, "\n"))

				// reset
				chunk = []string{}
			}
		} else {
			// we're still building the chunk
			chunk = append(chunk, line)
		}
	}

	// account for if there is no % at the very end of the file
	if len(chunk) > 0 {
		fortunes = append(fortunes, strings.Join(chunk, "\n"))
	}
	return fortunes
}
```

Why all this logic? It has to do with an important mechanic behind fortunes. When you open a "classic" fortune file, it will look like this:

```
%
Fortune text goes here.
  - by Happybread
%
Another fortune text goes here.

And this is the end
%
```

The separator in a fortune file is a lone `%` character. When we pick a fortune, it must preserve the newlines of the fortune:

```
Fortune text goes here.
  - by Happybread
```

Some files start with `%`, some don‚Äôt. Some end with `%`, some don‚Äôt. So I wrote `readFortunes` to account for that.

The function builds fortunes by appending lines into a `chunk` slice until it hits a `%` separator. When it does, it joins the `chunk` with newlines and appends it to the `fortunes` slice, then resets the chunk. The final check for `len(chunk) > 0` ensures the last fortune is included even if the file doesn't end with `%`.

Once we've read the fortunes, we pick one at random:

```go
fortune := chooseRandomElement(fortunes)
fmt.Println(fortune)
```

## üêà Building a GitHub Action to build the binary

I want other people to use my script as well. I want them to download it and run it on any operating system they want. Oh! Wait! Go is a compiled language. But if I compile it in WSL, can someone using Windows use my script? Yes!

To build for Windows, you can run

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/fortune.exe fortune.go
```

To build for Linux, you can run

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/fortune fortune.go
```

Great! Now I want this build to run every time I push to main. Luckily, GitHub actions can do this for us! We add an action into our `.github` folder and configure something like this:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Runs on every push to main
```

Then we can very quickly get Go installed onto our job:

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.23'
```

then we can create a `/bin` folder and build both binaries and save the output to this directory

```yml
  - name: Set a build directory
	run: mkdir -p bin
  - name: Build Linux binary
	run: |
	  GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/fortune fortune.go
  - name: Build Windows binary
	run: |
	  GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/fortune.exe fortune.go
```

Lastly, we can save the output as a GitHub release:

```yml
      - name: Delete existing latest tag if exists
        run: |
          git tag -d latest || true
          git push origin :refs/tags/latest || true

      - name: Create latest tag
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions"
          git config user.email "github-actions@users.noreply.github.com"
          git tag latest
          git push origin latest

      - name: Create Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          tag_name: latest
          name: "Latest Release"
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
          files: |
            bin/*
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## üö¢ Deploying to Production

To get the Cowsay when your terminal starts, add the `fortune` binary and fortunes folder to your `$HOME` directory. Then open your `.bashrc` file and add the following to the file:

```bash
talk(){
¬† ./fortune | cowsay
}
talk
```

If you're on Windows, use `./fortune.exe` instead. Then restart your terminal and now you should see:

Now to the last step... growing my collection!
